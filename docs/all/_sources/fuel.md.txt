# About Fuel

Fuel is a two-part web application for hosting and accessing simulation
assets. The first part is the [https://app.gazebosim.org website](https://app.gazebosim.org), which displays assets in a human
consumable manner. The second part is a backend server that manages the
simulation assets. See the [REST API](https://app.gazebosim.org/api) pages
for more information about the backend server's API.
